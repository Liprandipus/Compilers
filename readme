Was asked to create a flex program that recognizes :
1. Strings
2. Every number type ( hex, oct etc )
3. Identifiers
4. Reserved words
5. Operators

It was also requested to ignore the one or multiple lines comments.

In order to run the program, download the repository and type make in your command line prompt.
In case you want to test this on your own, just remove the "input.txt" and "ouput.txt" from the Makefile.
